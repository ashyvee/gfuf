<h1> EDUCATIONAL FIELD TRIP: DESTINATIONS AND EXPERIENCES </h1>
<h2> <b> CHANGE MAKER 2040 </b></h2>
<p> For this trip, we first started with a destination that blew minds, entertained eyes, and opened hearts to changing the Earth—the <b> Change Maker 2040 
Museum </b> located in Parañaque. The venue was unique since we hadn't visited anything like it before. We waited a few minutes before we could enter, where 
a short film was shown to us. The film was about the SDGs on how to make ourselves the so-called 'Change Maker'. Then, after watching the film, we were able 
to enter the room where toys, dioramas, and information were. We saw different visual aids or information about how to take care of the Earth—what to do, 
change, and maintain.<b> 17 Sustainable Development Goals </b>, which provide a framework for addressing global challenges, were shown to us. There were big 
and small fake or miniature creatures, toys to play with, coloring papers, and notes where you could write anything that you wanted to express. Overall, we 
learned different things that can help us have a positive societal change in the year 2040. These goals encompass various aspects of human development and 
environmental conservation in the future. The Change Maker 2040 impacted my perspective on how we can create a better world and secure a bright, positive 
future. With such an inspiring experience, this will surely be treasured in my heart forever. Exploring places like this is truly entertaining; not only that,
 we can also learn a lot of remarkable lessons. </p>
<h2> <b> AFP MUSEUM </b></h2>
<p> Our second destination is another museum. A museum that was like a time travel box brought us to the painful beauty of Philippine history. The place was 
overwhelming because of how big it was and how beautiful every view, building, and piece of equipment was there. It started with <b> Kuya Kimbot </b>, who was 
our tour guide in the <b> AFP Museum </b> . He put us on hold, and then he explained everything about the history and things of the museum in the most 
entertaining way. A lot of amazing objects from the past were displayed in the museum, containing a lot of stories that are important and also inspiring. 
There, we realized the pains that the Filipinos had to face before. And of course, it is a great destination to learn about the Armed Forces. Their equipment, 
like tanks, helicopters, and guns, was really fascinating. This itinerary was eye-opening to youth like us on what the Philippines should mean to Filipinos. 
We were not allowed to take pictures of some places there, but our eyes surely captured many memories that will be kept in our hearts forever.</p>
<h2> <b>  MALL OF ASIA </b></h2>
<p> <b> The Mall of Asia </b> is visited by a lot of students. This is where we ate lunch, went shopping with our friends, and saw the beautiful view of the 
sea. It was so big and spacious that it looked like we were lost, but the huge place brought so much excitement to us. We were given a small amount of time to 
enjoy the mall, but we still enjoyed it to the fullest together with our friends that we wanted to create more memories with. We got to roam through many shops 
and food stalls. We windowshop at shops like NBA stores. We also enjoyed eating French fries, Ilao Ilao Shawarma, and more. And we enjoyed the view of Metro 
Manila and the seaside. 
MOA is a big place to make big memories. </p>
<h2> <b>  LUNETA PARK </b></h2>
<p> After enjoying MOA, we were back to gathering information about our educational field trip. This park is not just a simple park; this place carries the 
deeply treasured but painful past of the Filipinos and the Philippines. This park is where we got to know the hero behind  <q> Ang kabataan ang Pag-asa ng 
Bayan </q> which we youth should always remember. We were toured while we learned more about our national hero, <b> Gat. Jose Rizal </b> , with the help of our
 tour guide. Learning about the life of our national hero, Jose Rizal, is truly inspirational. His patriotism brought a lot of contributions to our country. 
For me, exploring Luneta Park is not just educational; it is also an experience that is special and truly remarkable. Luneta Park brought so much information 
and heart-wrenching experiences, especially for Grade 10 students who are currently studying El Filibusterismo. Sadly, we just spent a little time here since 
the weather is so hot, but in that small amount of time, a lot of information was gathered. </p>
<h2> <b> STAR CITY </b> </h2>
<p> Now, let's go to the most-awaited destination of all. This is what we've been waiting for the whole trip. This is where a lot of happiness, laughter, cries,
 worries, and memories were seen. This place shines like a star in the eyes of every student on our field trip. We ride on a lot of rides even if worries are 
in our eyes because of how scary and big they are. <b> Star Flyer, Vikings, Surf Dance, and Jungle Splash </b>  were just some of the scariest rides there. Some
 of us cried, some acted fine, and some were really brave. Each ride brought us different emotions that would serve as happy memories in our lives. But there 
were also <b> Snow Worlds, Gabi ng Lagim, and Bump Cars </b> that were not scary but really enjoyable. Sunset was also witnessed in Star City; it was really 
beautiful, like how beautiful our successful trip was. Exploring Star City felt like healing my inner child. Riding extreme rides, roaming around the whole 
amusement park, eating foods from stalls, and bonding with my classmates and teachers were such a great experience. I will never forget this moment, where we 
chased our dreams and made memories together. Exploring Star City felt like healing my inner child. Riding extreme rides, roaming around the whole amusement
